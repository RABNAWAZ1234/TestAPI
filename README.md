# TestAPI
I used restframework to making API. We can provide the information to user based on some conditionals.
When we set AllowAny then anyone can access the user data.
When we set IsAuthenticated then concern person can access the data
Others conditions can be applied based on our requirements.
These changing has been done in urls.py file
